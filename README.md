### Contributing to Documentation

There are several ways to contribute to our documentation:

1. **Direct Editing**: Each page has an "Edit this page" link at the bottom. Clicking this will take you to GitHub where you can make changes directly to the documentation.

2. **Visual Editor**: No visual editor is currently supported, but you can use an external application to edit the documentation and commit the changes to this Github repository.

3. **File Creation**: Documentation pages are written in Markdown (.md) or MDX (.mdx) format:
   - Markdown (.md) files are simple text files with basic formatting
   - MDX (.mdx) files allow for more advanced features like interactive React components

If you're new to Markdown, don't worry! It's a simple way to format text:
- Use `#` for headings
- Use `*` or `-` for bullet points
- Use `**text**` for bold
- Use `[text](url)` for links

## For Documentation Maintainers

The following sections are for technical users who maintain and deploy the documentation.

### About the Platform

This documentation website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern documentation platform that provides:
- Markdown-based content
- Versioning
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Search functionality
- Plugin system
- React-based customization

### Requirements

- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Getting Started

#### Check out the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:decode-development/fasp-documentation.git
cd fasp-documentation
```

#### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

#### Local Development Setup

Before starting the local development server, ensure that the API documentation files are generated by running the following command:

```bash
npm run gen-api-docs:all
```

#### Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Documentation Management

#### Versioning Documentation

To create a new version for all documentation:

```bash
npm run docusaurus docs:version 1.0
```

This will:
- Create a snapshot of your current docs as a new version
- Set the current version as the latest version
- Create a new version dropdown

The following files will be updated/created:
- The current docs will be copied to a new version directory (under `versioned_docs`)
- The current sidebar will be copied to a new version sidebar (under `versioned_sidebars`)
- The `versions.json` file will be updated to include the new version

**Note:**
If using the API documentation version, you will need to manually exclude the 
`api` folder from the `versioned_docs` folder. You also need to update the
sidebar under `versioned_sidebars` to exclude all the API sidebars.

**Important:**
The [Docusaurus documentation on versioning](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning)
has more details on how versioning works in Docusaurus. Including information on
when it is appropriate to create a new version and how to manage versions.

#### API Documentation

##### Adding a New API Version

1. Add the new OpenAPI/Swagger JSON or YAML file under `static/api/`
2. Update the `docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs` configuration in `docusaurus.config.js` to include the new version
3. Generate the API documentation:
```bash
npm run gen-api-docs:all
```
4. Update the sidebar configuration in `sidebars.js` to include the new API version sidebar

##### Updating API Documentation

To regenerate API documentation:
```bash
# Generate API docs
npm run gen-api-docs:all

# If needed, clean existing API docs first
npm run clean-api-docs:all
```

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

#### Branch Strategy

This repository uses a simple workflow:
- `main`: Main development branch, triggers deployments
- Feature branches: For development of new content

#### Development Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Edit documentation files
   - Test locally using `npm start`
   - Commit changes with meaningful messages

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Push feature branch to GitHub
   - Create PR targeting `main` branch
   - Get review and approval
   - Merge to `main` (this will automatically trigger deployment)

#### Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD, configured in `.github/workflows/documentation.yml`.

The CI pipeline:
1. Triggers on push/PR to `main` branch
2. Sets up Node.js environment
3. Installs dependencies
4. Generates API documentation
5. Builds the Docusaurus site
6. Deploys to GitHub Pages (only on push to `main`, not on PR)

To monitor deployments:
1. Go to repository Actions tab
2. Look for "Documentation Platform CI" workflow
3. Check deployment status and logs
4. Access the deployed site via environment URL

**Note:** The CI process will only deploy when changes are merged to the `main` branch, ensuring controlled and reviewed deployments.

### Building and Deployment

#### Local Build

```bash
# Build the website
npm run build

# Test the build locally
npm run serve
```

The `build` command generates static content into the `build` directory.

#### Deploying to GitHub Pages

Deployment is handled automatically by our CI pipeline when changes are merged to the `main` branch. 

For manual deployment (if needed):
```bash
USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Note: Manual deployment should only be used in exceptional circumstances. Prefer the CI-based deployment process through the `main` branch.

### Plugins

#### OpenAPI Documentation

This project uses [docusaurus-openapi-docs](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs) for API documentation.

Key features:
- Automatic API documentation generation from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Interactive API playground
- Support for multiple API versions

A demo and documentation can be found at [docusaurus-openapi.tryingpan.dev](https://docusaurus-openapi.tryingpan.dev/).

#### Search

Local search functionality is provided by [docusaurus-search-local](https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local).

Features:
- Offline search capability
- Multiple language support
- Customizable search settings

#### Image Zoom

This project uses [docusaurus-plugin-image-zoom](https://gabrielcsapo.github.io/docusaurus-plugin-image-zoom/docs/getting-started/) for image zooming. This plugin uses [medium-zoom](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom) under the hood.

Features:
- Zoom on click
- Configurable options

### WYSIWYG Editors

To allow for non-technical users to edit the documentation, there are various 
options for CMS (Content Management Systems). 

These usually take the form of a hosted 3rd-party service that integrates 
with your Git repository, such as:
- [Holocron CMS](https://holocron.so/docusaurus-editor)
- [Dhub](https://dhub.io/)

Or a self-hosted option, such as:
- [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/)
- [Sveltia CMS](https://sveltia.com/)

The main difference between the two is that Decap CMS uses a traditional 
CMS editor with a sidebar tree view, while Sveltia CMS uses a more modern, 
React-based editor with a sidebar tree view. Sveltia CMS was built to be a drop
-in replacement for Decap CMS, with some additional features.

Docusaurus has a feature-request issue for a built-in CMS editor, but it is not
currently supported. [Read more](https://docusaurus.io/feature-requests/p/make-content-editing-easier).

#### Authentication

Embedded CMS require an OAuth2 backend to handle authentication. There are a
few off-the-shelf solutions for this such as [Sveltia CMS Auth](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms-auth).

It can be deployed as a Cloudflare worker and hooked up to a Github OAuth application.
Set `baseUrl` in the CMS `config.yml` to the base URL of the OAuth application.

#### Nested folders

Decap CMS supports [nested folders (beta)](https://decapcms.org/docs/collection-nested/), which 
allows for more complex content organization, however the directory structure is
limited to a single level of folders.

Sveltia CMS does not support nested folders yet.

Any new folders added under `/docs` will need to be added to collections in
`/admin/config.yml` and `/cms/config.yml`.
