# QAT-ERP Integrations

QAT has several data integrations with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, as shown in the below diagram. 

There are 3 main types of interfaces between QAT and external systems

1. **Supply plan sharing.** QAT sends supply plans to external systems. Currently QAT shares supply plans with the GHSC-PSM order management system ARTMIS, and to the GFPVAN. 
1. **Catalog Updates.** QAT receives the ARTMIS product catalog, which updates the QAT planning unit details
1. **ERP Shipment linking** Currently the only active ERP shipment linking interface is with ARTMIS for GHSC-PSM orders. 

To summarise:

- QAT receives ARTMIS Orders and Shipments  
- QAT sends QAT shipments to ARTMIS  
- QAT sends QAT Program IDs to ARTMIS
