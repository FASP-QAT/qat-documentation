# QAT Interfaces

This section describes the data exchange interfaces between QAT and ARTMIS and GFPVAN.

## File formats

The following file formats are used for data exchange:

* Files shared with ARTMIS are done via SFTP (xml formats); 
* Files imported from Pipeline and Quantimed are via xml- (formats dictated by each software).
* Files shared with GFPVAN are JSON.

Note that edits are made to the ERP-linking functionality, after which time this section will updated to include those edits, including detail on fields to be shared and which items are shared as deltas versus full files. Only if the scripts below fail will QAT send an automated notification of this failure.

:::warning FIXME
Clarify the paragraph above - it's not clear what it means, and if it's still relevant.

## QAT Server Scripts

The following scripts are used to transfer data between QAT and external systems:
